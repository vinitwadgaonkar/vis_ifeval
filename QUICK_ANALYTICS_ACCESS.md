# 🔒 Quick Access to Private Analytics

## ✅ EASIEST METHOD - GitHub Insights (Works Right Now!)

**No setup needed!** GitHub Insights is already available:

👉 **Go to:** https://github.com/vinitwadgaonkar/vis_ifeval/insights/traffic

You'll see:
- ✅ Unique visitors
- ✅ Total views  
- ✅ Clones
- ✅ Referring sites
- ✅ Popular content

**This is PRIVATE** - only you (repository owner) can see it!

## 📊 Enable GitHub Pages Dashboard (Optional)

If you want the fancy dashboard with charts:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/vinitwadgaonkar/vis_ifeval/settings/pages
2. Under **"Source"**, select: **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Under **"Branch"**, select: **"main"**
4. Under **"Folder"**, select: **"/docs"** ⚠️ (NOT /docs/analytics)
5. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Wait 1-2 Minutes
- GitHub will build your site
- You'll see a green checkmark when ready

### Step 3: Access Dashboard
- URL: `https://vinitwadgaonkar.github.io/vis_ifeval/analytics/`
- ⚠️ **Keep this URL private** - don't share publicly

## 🚀 Alternative: View Data Directly

You can also view the analytics data directly in the repository:

👉 **File:** https://github.com/vinitwadgaonkar/vis_ifeval/blob/main/docs/analytics/data/visits.json

This JSON file is updated hourly by the GitHub Action.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**404 Error?**
- Make sure you selected `/docs` (not `/docs/analytics`) as the folder
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages
- Check: https://github.com/vinitwadgaonkar/vis_ifeval/settings/pages

**No data showing?**
- GitHub Insights needs 24-48 hours to collect initial data
- The GitHub Action runs hourly to aggregate data
- Check Actions tab to see if workflow is running

**Can't find Settings?**
- Make sure you're logged in
- You need admin/owner access to the repository

## 💡 Recommendation

**Just use GitHub Insights** - it's the easiest and works immediately:
